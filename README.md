Enemy Assault
============

A 2D Game with a Vector Graphics art style in OpenGL

Gameplay
===
The player controls a ship/craft of sorts that only faces forward while viewed from top-down. It can move side to side and up and down to dodge incoming enemies and projectiles, as well as shoot its own projectiles. Pickups and bonus objects give the player's craft better abilities, such as stronger bullets or multiple guns that shoot in different directions. The game automtically scrolls down to give the sense of urgency, increasing over time. The longer the player survives and the more enemies he shoots the more points are received.

Graphics
===
The art style will borrow heavily from vector-graphics games from the 1980s, found on consoles such as the Vectrex. Polygons will be outlined with bright colors that contrast the dark background they are placed on. Effects such as explosions and such will also be kept simple.

Basically I don't want to have to rely on artists.
